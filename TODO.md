## üìå To-Do List
### üîπ Tier 1: High Priority / Foundation Features

These should be done first because other features depend on them or they fix core issues.

1. Export/Share Links (Compress Build Data into URL)

    - Core to sharing builds.

    - Dependency: Required before Import Links (Task 2).

2. Import Links (Parse Shared Build URL)

    - Depends on Task 1.

3. Fix Responsive Layout Issue

    - Trees should never overflow their container at smaller screen widths.

4. Fix ```renderLevelTimeline``` not appearing when a build is loaded

    - Important bug fix for consistency.

5. Code Optimization (Refactor, DRY, Modularize)

    - Will make future features easier to implement.

### üîπ Tier 2: Medium Priority / Usability Enhancements

These improve the user experience significantly.

6. Multi-Build Tabs (View multiple builds in one session)

    - Useful for comparison.

    - Depends on stable save/load system.

8. Add Titles/Tooltips to Buttons (Save, Load, Export, etc.)

    - Improves clarity for first-time users.

11. Option to Set Favorite Versions (Quick Access)

    - Depends on version/expansion selection system.

13. Add Option to Change Color Theme of UI
