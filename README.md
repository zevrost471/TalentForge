# TalentForge - WoW Talent Tree Calculator & Builder
TalentForge is a flexible, data-driven talent calculator &amp; builder for Warcraft-style talent systems. 

It allows you to create, edit and share custom talent trees and supports multiple patches, expansions and even private-server content.

## Key features

- Multi-patch/expansion support (Vanilla, TBC, WotLK â€” add more patch diffs).

- Private-server friendly: load alternative patch definitions and custom talent sets.

- Full custom tree editor: add/modify talents, ranks, rows/columns, prerequisites and visual placement.

- Interactive UI: learn/unlearn talents, tier checks, dependency arrows and tooltips.

- Export / Import builds: compact shareable build strings, JSON import/export, and clipboard paste.

- Save & name builds locally (and optionally share via URL).

- Build serialization compatible with versioned talent data (so a build references the patch it was made for).

- Print / export options (PNG/SVG/copyable snapshot) for sharing or documentation.

- Small, single-file reference UI that can be integrated into larger sites or decoupled into modules.

## Why this repo exists

TalentForge makes it easy to:

- Compare how the same class performs across different expansions.

- Prototype custom talent systems for private servers or mods.

- Share and store builds with others.
