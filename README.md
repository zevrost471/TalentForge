# TalentForge
TalentForge — a multi-patch talent calculator &amp; builder. Create, edit and share custom talent trees.

TalentForge is a flexible, data-driven talent calculator and builder for Warcraft-style talent systems. It supports multiple patches and expansions (including private-server content), lets you author and test custom talent trees, and provides fast export/import and sharing of builds.

Key features

Multi-patch/expansion support (Vanilla, TBC, WotLK — add more patch diffs).

Private-server friendly: load alternative patch definitions and custom talent sets.

Full custom tree editor: add/modify talents, ranks, rows/columns, prerequisites and visual placement.

Interactive UI: learn/unlearn talents, tier checks, dependency arrows and tooltips.

Export / Import builds: compact shareable build strings, JSON import/export, and clipboard paste.

Save & name builds locally (and optionally share via URL).

Build serialization compatible with versioned talent data (so a build references the patch it was made for).

Print / export options (PNG/SVG/copyable snapshot) for sharing or documentation.

Small, single-file reference UI that can be integrated into larger sites or decoupled into modules.

Why this repo exists

TalentForge makes it easy to:

Compare how the same class performs across different expansions.

Prototype custom talent systems for private servers or mods.

Share and store builds with others without needing a server backend.
